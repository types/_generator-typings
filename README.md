## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-typings using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```sh
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-typings
```

## Usage

There are several ways to create your typings repository:

Here are examples to create [`npm-noop2`](https://github.com/typed-typings/npm-noop2)

```sh
# create the github repo from github website
# under your organization folder (e.g. /somewhere/typed-typings/)
yo typings npm-noop2

# Once it is done,
cd npm-noop2
```

```sh
# create the github repo from github website
# clone it locally to your machine (e.g. into /somewhere/typed-typings/npm-noop2/)
# in that directory:
yo typings
```

```sh
# create the github repo from github website
# under your organization folder (e.g. /somewhere/typed-typings/)
mkdir npm-noop2 && cd npm-noop2
yo typings
```



## How to write typings

## About writing tests for typings

Simply shape test (like those in DefinitelyTyped) is not sufficient.
Since there is no type in javascript, even if you create a wrong signature, you won't detect it until runtime.

e.g.

```js
// source code
function foo(something) {
  return something++;
}
```

The source code expects `something` to be a number. If you write your typings as:

```ts
function foo(something: string): string;
```

It won't fail until you use it. i.e.

```ts
// consumer program
import foo ....somehow

let x = "abc";
foo(x);
```

Because your typings provide guidance to the consumer, they will write their code that way and will fail when they run it.
`tsc` will compile fine.
